/*
User can publish review about app. Reviews have a major influence on the user’s
purchase decision [7]. Average rating according to the star principle as well as the num-
ber of reviews given determine the buying decision of an app to a very large degree.
Review area is explored when it comes to see what the sentiment of the review is. Re-
view can have positive or negative sentiment [8]. Analyzing reviews is done by text
mining [9]. Most of the feedback is provided shortly after new releases, with a quickly
decreasing frequency over time. Reviews typically contain multiple topics, such as user
experience, bug reports, and feature requests [10]. Reviews are source for users’ feed-
back, requests for new features or reporting bugs. Reviews represent feature requests,
i.e. comments through which users either suggest new features for an app or express
preferences for the re-design of already existing features of an app [11]. Reviews can
be specific, as specific is an app. Analyzing feedbacks from a health and fitness-track-
ing app shows that the users of health and fitness-related apps are concerned about their
physical activity records and physiological records. The records include track, distance,
time, and calories burned during jogging or walking. App store reviews are used to
analyze different aspects of app development and evolution [12]. There are proposed
frameworks to acquire reviews in large number, extract informative user reviews by*/
